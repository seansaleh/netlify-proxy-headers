	  <p>This is a proof of concept site where I attempted to set response headers from a Netlify 200 proxied request. I was unable to set a response header in proxied requests via any of these methods. You can follow along by opening the below links and looking at the network headers in your browser's devtools
	  <p><a href="https://github.com/seansaleh/netlify-proxy-headers">Github source repository</a>
	  <p><a href="/">/  /index.html  200</a><br>	#From _redirects, will show headers in response
	  <p><a href="/splat/test">/splat/*  https://httpbin.org/anything/:splat  200</a><br>	#From _redirects, will not set headers in either request or response. Headers are set both in _headers and netlify.toml
	  <p><a href="/other/test">[[redirects]]<br>from = "/other/*"<br>to = "https://httpbin.org/anything/:splat"<br>status = 200<br>force = true<br>headers = {X-From = "Netlify", X-Api-Key = "some-api-key-string"}</a>\<br>	#From netlify.toml, header set as part of redirects definition. Header is only appended to request
	  <p><a href="/fizz">[[redirects]]<br>from = "/fizz"<br>to = "https://httpbin.org/anything/buzz"<br>status = 200<br>force = false<br>headers = {X-From = "Netlify-fizz"}</a><br>	#From netlify.toml, no splat used. Header set at part of redirects definition. Header is only appended to request
	  <p>In the source for <a href="https://github.com/seansaleh/netlify-proxy-headers/blob/master/netlify.toml">netlify.toml</a> you can view more attempt I made to get headers set on the response from a netlify proxied request.
	  <br>I would expect that at least one of the ways to set headers, either via _headers or defining them in [[headers]] would be able to set a response header in Netlify.
